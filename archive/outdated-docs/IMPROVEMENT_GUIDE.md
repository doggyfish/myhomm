    // Test AI makes decisions
    game.handleAI();
    this.assertTrue(game.armies.some(a => a.owner === aiPlayer), "AI should create armies");
}

async testResourceSystem() {
    const game = this.createTestGame();
    const castle = game.castles[0];
    castle.gold = 0;
    
    castle.produceUnit();
    this.assertEqual(castle.unitCount, 10, "Should not produce units without gold");
