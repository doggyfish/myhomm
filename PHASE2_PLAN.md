- **Expanding**: Focusing on territorial growth and resource acquisition

### **Priority 2: Resource Management System (High Impact)**

#### **2.1 Gold-Based Economy**
**Objective**: Add economic depth and strategic resource allocation decisions

```javascript
// Economic System Configuration
const ECONOMIC_SYSTEM = {
    playerStartingGold: 100,
    castleGoldProduction: 2, // Gold per second
    unitProductionCosts: {
        infantry: 3,
        archers: 4,
        cavalry: 6
    },
    upgradeBaseCosts: {
        production: 100,
        defense: 150,
        capacity: 200
    }
};
```

**Implementation Features**:

- **Strategic Choices**: Players must balance unit production with upgrades
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited gold creates meaningful economic decisions

#### **2.2 Economic Integration**
**Player Resource Management**:
```javascript
class Player {
    // Resource management methods
    addGold(amount) {
        this.resources.gold += amount;
    }
    
    spendGold(amount) {
        if (this.resources.gold >= amount) {
            this.resources.gold -= amount;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    canAfford(cost) {
        return this.resources.gold >= cost;
    }
}
```

**Castle Economic Integration**:
```javascript
class Castle {
    updateGoldProduction(currentTime) {
        const timeSinceLastGold = currentTime - this.lastGoldTime;
        if (timeSinceLastGold >= 1000) { // Every second
            const goldToAdd = this.goldProduction * Math.floor(timeSinceLastGold / 1000);
            this.owner.addGold(goldToAdd);
            this.lastGoldTime = currentTime;
        }
    }
    
    canAffordUnit() {
        return this.owner.canAfford(this.unitCost);
    }
}
```

### **Priority 3: Multiple Unit Types System (Medium Impact)**

#### **3.1 Diverse Unit Production**
**Objective**: Create tactical depth through varied unit types with different capabilities

```javascript
// Enhanced Unit Type System
const UNIT_TYPES = {
    infantry: {
        cost: 3,
        productionTime: 1000, // 1 second
        description: "Basic melee fighters",
        startingCount: 10
    },
    cavalry: {
        cost: 6,
        productionTime: 3000, // 3 seconds
        description: "Fast mounted warriors",
        startingCount: 0
    },
    archers: {
        cost: 4,
        productionTime: 2000, // 2 seconds
        description: "Ranged combat specialists",
        startingCount: 0
    }
};
```

**Implementation Features**:
- **Different Production Frequencies**: Each unit type has unique production timing
- **Varied Costs**: Strategic resource allocation decisions
- **Castle Integration**: Castles manage multiple production queues simultaneously
- **Army Composition**: Armies contain mixed unit types for tactical variety

#### **3.2 Production Queue System**
**Multi-Type Production Management**:
```javascript
class Castle {
    updateProduction(currentTime) {
        let unitProduced = false;
        
        // Check each unit type for production readiness
        Object.keys(this.unitTypes).forEach(unitType => {
            if (this.checkUnitTypeProduction(unitType, currentTime)) {
                this.produceUnitOfType(unitType);
                unitProduced = true;
            }
        });
        
        return unitProduced;
    }
    
    produceUnitOfType(unitType) {
        const unitData = this.unitTypes[unitType];
        if (this.owner.spendGold(unitData.cost)) {
            unitData.count++;
            unitData.lastProduced = Date.now();
        }
    }
}
```

#### **3.3 Army Composition System**
**Mixed Unit Type Armies**:
```javascript
class Castle {
    calculateArmyComposition(totalToSend) {
        const composition = {
            infantry: 0,
            cavalry: 0,
            archers: 0
        };
        
        // Distribute units proportionally
        Object.keys(this.unitTypes).forEach(unitType => {
            const availableOfType = this.unitTypes[unitType].count;
            const proportionToSend = Math.min(availableOfType, Math.floor(totalToSend * 0.33));
            composition[unitType] = proportionToSend;
        });
        
        return composition;
    }
}
```

### **Priority 4: Player Elimination System (Medium Impact)**

#### **4.1 Elimination Mechanics**
**Objective**: Implement proper endgame conditions and army cleanup

```javascript
class Game {
    checkWinConditions() {
        // Check for player elimination (lost all castles)
        this.players.forEach(player => {
            const playerCastles = this.castles.filter(c => c.owner === player);
            const playerArmies = this.armies.filter(a => a.owner === player);
            
            // If player has no castles, eliminate their armies
            if (playerCastles.length === 0 && playerArmies.length > 0) {
                this.eliminatePlayer(player);
            }
        });
        
        // Check for victory conditions
        this.determineGameOutcome();
    }
}
```

**Implementation Features**:
- **Automatic Army Removal**: When players lose all castles, armies are eliminated
- **AI System Integration**: Eliminated AI players removed from decision systems
- **Enhanced Victory Conditions**: Detect human victories, defeats, and AI-only outcomes
- **Clean State Management**: Proper cleanup prevents orphaned game objects

#### **4.2 Elimination Logic**
**Player Elimination Process**:
```javascript
eliminatePlayer(player) {
    console.log(`Player ${player.name} has been eliminated - removing all armies`);
    
    // Mark all player's armies for removal
    this.armies.forEach(army => {
        if (army.owner === player) {
            army.shouldBeRemoved = true;
        }
    });
    
    // Remove AI player from AI system
    if (!player.isHuman && this.systems.ai) {
        this.systems.ai.removeAIPlayer(player.id);
    }
    
    // Update statistics
    player.updateStatistics({ 
        eliminated: true,
        eliminationTime: Date.now() - this.gameStartTime 
    });
}
```

### **Priority 5: Castle Upgrade System (Medium Impact)**

#### **5.1 Active Upgrade Mechanics**
**Objective**: Provide progression systems and strategic development choices

```javascript
// Upgrade System Configuration

            effect: "20% faster unit production per level",
            maxLevel: 5
        },
        defense: {
            baseCost: 150,
            effect: "10% defensive bonus per level",
            maxLevel: 5
        },
        capacity: {
            baseCost: 200,
            effect: "100 additional unit storage per level",
            maxLevel: 3
        }
    },
    costMultiplier: 1.5 // Each level costs 1.5x more
};
```

**Implementation Features**:

        if (this.owner.canAfford(cost)) {
            if (this.owner.spendGold(cost)) {
                this.upgrades[upgradeType]++;
                this.applyUpgrade(upgradeType);
                this.triggerUpgradeEffects(upgradeType);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    getUpgradeCost(upgradeType) {
        const baseCosts = {
            production: 100,
            defense: 150,
            capacity: 200
        };
        
        const currentLevel = this.upgrades[upgradeType] || 0;
        return baseCosts[upgradeType] * Math.pow(1.5, currentLevel);
    }
}
